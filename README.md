##Welcome to Burst

##About Us
We are a bipartisan app created for curious individuals who want to burst their political filter bubble and achieve a clearer view of the news.

##Our Misson
We created this app because we recognize the growing disparity between liberal and conservative affiliations and their respective political “filter bubbles”. We want to create an open-minded community that allows users to “burst” their bubble by connecting them with differing perspectives and encouraging them to engage with content and users outside of their political filter bubbles.
