      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We are a bipartisan app created for curious individuals who want to burst
       their political filter bubble and achieve a clearer view of the news.</p>
      <h3>Our Misson</h3>
      <p>
        We created this app because we recognize the growing disparity between liberal
        and conservative affiliations and their respective political “filter bubbles”.
        We want to create an open-minded community that allows users to “burst” their
        bubble by connecting them with differing perspectives.
        </p>
      <h3>What Is A Filter Bubble?</h3>
      <p>
        "Filter bubbles" are a result of the algorithms that are used by many mediums to deliver
        more personalized and relevant search results. While this is very convenient, it can also
        result in isolation of ideas and lack of awareness of differing perspectives. Our algorithms
        are written to deliver you the news from both sources you select as well as sources outside
        of your bubble.
